# SWARYEB-SWExporter-bridge
Since SW-Exporter does not have a working plugin-system at the moment, 
this little python-script will be used to bridge data between 
SW-Exporter and the SWAR-YEB-Ankulua-Bot.

## Usage  
1.  <br />
Edit variable runfilepath = "" in start_bridge.py with full path to <username>-<userid>-runs.csv in Summoners War Exporter Files-Directory.  <br />
For example: runfilepath = "C:\Users\exampleuser\Desktop\Summoners War Exporter Files\exampleuser-9890012-runs.csv"  <br />
2.  <br />
Run "run_bridge_windows.cmd"   <br />
3.  <br />
put IP of device running the bridge into Ankulua-Script-Options  <br />
